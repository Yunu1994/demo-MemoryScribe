	上周的课件讲了如何制作low fidelity prototype，比如在纸面上绘制wireframe，做story board。我们错过了，所以需要抓紧赶上。
	So, first off, we missed last week’s seminar that covered how to create low-fidelity prototypes, like drawing wireframes on paper or creating a storyboard. so we’ll need to move quickly to catch up.
	实际上我们的任务4是逆向、反向构建的。最开始我就有了mid fidelity的设想和实现的工具。设想的feature是自动生成日记、基于日记的emotional chatbot、通过本地ai模型实现隐私。并且这三个组件我都已经能用obsidian和插件制作出来了。
	That being said, our Task 4 is actually a bit different from other groups—it’s more of a reverse, backward process compared to others. From the start, I already had a mid-fidelity idea in mind, and I’ve got the tools to implement it. The core features still are automatic journal generation, an emotional chatbot based on the journal databse, and privacy handled through a local AI model. And I’ve already managed to put these components together using Obsidian and a few plugins.
		所以普通的任务4的流程是基于任务3的研究，先做low fidelity，绘制纸面的设计，收集建议，写文档，然后做mid fidelity。
		so the typical flow for Task 4 would be to start with Task 3’s research, create a low-fidelity prototype first (like drawing the design on paper), gather feedback, write up a report, and then move on to building a mid-fidelity version.
		但我们的是反过来，已经能做出了mid fidelity，然后我们把那三个feature没有整合时/独立的模块作为low fidelity。相应的，我们在report里的wireframe和story board，就是对着已有的功能模块进行描述。
		But in our case, we’ve already made progress in developing the mid-fidelity version. So, what we’re doing is kind of backwards. We’re taking the three modules seperately as our low-fidelity prototype. and taking integrated version as our mid-fidelity one. For the report where we show the wireframes and the storyboard, we’ll be simply describing the features and the interfaces of the modules we already have.
		甚至于我们打算直接用obsidian的界面作为low fidelity的展示，因为软件比纸面展示更方便。
		In fact, we’re thinking of using the Obsidian interface itself as our low-fidelity prototype, since showing the actual software will be a lot more effective than just sketching things on paper.
	任务的分工是你们三个人负责part1的document，大致就是设计的背景、idea、low fidelity的截图、收集的建议和反思，任务量和ass2差不多。而我负责part2的制作和最后的presentation。最后presentation的文稿也需要你们帮忙一起构思。
	you will be responsible for Part 1 of the document. That’s mainly the background of our design, the overall ideation, low-fidelity screenshots, feedback we gather, and your reflections. The amount of work should be similar to Assignment 2. 
	I’ll handle Part 2, which is the actual build and the final presentation. 
	But when it comes to the presentation script, I’ll need your help brainstorming and putting that together.
	另外需要你们下载obsidian并且会用这些模块，我会把我的vault同步给你们，这样在你们的电脑上可以实现一样的效果，截图或者描述时你们就可以对着自己的obsidian操作了。
	One more thing—you’ll need to download Obsidian and get familiar with the modules I’ve set up. I’ll sync my vault with you, so you’ll have everything on your own computers. That way, when you need to take screenshots or write descriptions, you can work directly within your own Obsidian setup. It’ll make things a lot smoother when we’re preparing the report.
